# Photography

I started Photography since 2018 i only use mobilephone that time because camera where so expensive unlike today it can be installment or lay away method.im getting interested and want to learn new skills through photography and that's why i save some of my allowance and bought a camera. my very first camera is Nikon 3500D and Upgraded to Canon and last 2021 i upgrade to Sony A6000. im really thankful for those people who trusted me in my work and hopefully will upgrade soon.
